"""
Recursive deep-research question generator.

This reimplements the existing data-generation pipeline as a recursive
search tree:
1) Start from a root query (wiki entity name).
2) Recursively expand child queries until depth/novelty/LLM-stop.
3) Aggregate all extracted statements as evidence.
4) Generate a long-form research question + rubrics from the evidence.

Defaults are conservative (depth=3, branching<=3, nodes<=50) and largely
reuse the prompt templates from the original implementation.

BASE_QA_TREE_PROMPT = '''You are an autonomous agent for proposing **deep-research questions** from a search tree.

Input is a compact JSON representation of a search tree with:
- `nodes`: id, parent, depth, query, children
- `leaves`: leaf id, path (root->leaf queries), and evidence statements for that leaf

Your task is to define a **complete, well-formed research problem** that ultimately requires a **long-form, structured answer**.
You are expected to make the question self-contained and answerable in scope (but you are NOT expected to solve it).

Important: The tree may contain **noise** or even **harmful/irrelevant information** that is not related to the root topic.
You must identify and avoid such nodes/claims when forming the question and rubrics. If a leaf is misleading or harmful but must be addressed, reflect this with **negative-weight rubrics** that require debunking or exclusion.

You must:
1) Select a **small set of leaf nodes** that best cover distinct facets of the root topic.
2) Perform a **bottom-up merge**: combine selected leaf queries into intermediate queries, then merge those into the final research question.
3) Create rubrics **grounded only in statements from the selected leaves**.
4) Provide a **visualizable reasoning trace**: which leaves were selected, why, and how they were merged step-by-step.

### Bottom-up merge requirements
- Start from selected leaves (last-layer nodes). Group them into **multiple** intermediate queries.
- Then merge intermediate queries **iteratively** into higher-level queries until you reach one final question.
- The merge can take **many steps**; This is a reasoning process; include it in `merge_trace` with **explicit inputs, outputs, and short rationale**.  Each merge step should explain why those inputs were grouped and what new query they form.

### Rubric Types
Each rubric MUST belong to exactly one of the following categories:
- **Logical**: structure/organization/reasoning checks for a long-form answer.
- **Factual**: specific facts/claims that must be addressed, each **supported by evidence from selected leaves only**.

### Weighting
- Assign each rubric an importance score between **0 and 1**
- Higher weight means the rubric is more critical to answering the question correctly
- Negative weight means the rubric captures **misleading/irrelevant/harmful** content that should be explicitly rejected, debunked, or excluded from the answer
- Weights do not need to sum to 1

### Rubric quality (applies to every rubric)
- Make each rubric precise, atomic, and binary-checkable; avoid vague verbs.
- Anchor factual rubrics to concrete supporting statements from the selected leaf evidence; do not invent new facts.
- Cover evidence breadth & attribution, reasoning soundness, completeness of expected findings, organization/clarity, and handling of ambiguity or counterpoints.
- Keep rubrics concise and avoid duplicate checks.
- Each rubric item must be evaluated independently and must not depend on the satisfaction or failure of any other rubric item.
- Every rubric MUST include `source_leaf_ids` and all ids must be a subset of `selected_leaf_ids`.


### Question Construction
- The question should be motivated by the selected rubrics and evidence.
- It should expose meaningful gaps, unresolved relationships, or implicit constraints.
- It must NOT be fully answerable using the provided material alone.
- Do NOT explicitly list rubrics or solution steps in the question.
- Prefer questions that are brief, precise, and research-heavy.
- Do NOT invent facts beyond the material.
- You MUST generate a minimum of 5 rubrics in the output.
- The rubrics should be numbered sequentially (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5...)
