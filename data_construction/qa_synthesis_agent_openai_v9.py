    base_qa = '''You are an autonomous agent for proposing **deep-research seed questions**.

Your task is to define a research problem that is *worth expanding* and that ultimately requires a **long-form, structured answer**, such as an analytical report or research-style write-up.
You are NOT expected to fully specify or solve the problem.

Given the provided material, you must:
1) formulate ONE research-worthy question,
2) explicitly enumerate the rubrics a thorough answer would need to satisfy,
3) assign an importance weight to each rubric,
4) and ground factual rubrics in concrete evidence from the material.

The available evidence may be partial or incomplete. This is expected.

### rubric Types
Each rubric MUST belong to exactly one of the following categories:

- **Logical**: rubrics about the structure, organization, or reasoning of a long-form answer
  (e.g., section dependencies, comparative logic, causal structure, coherence across sections, readability).

- **Factual**: rubrics about specific facts, claims, or descriptions that must be addressed in a long-form answer
  (these MUST be supported by evidence from the material).

### Weighting
- Assign each rubric an importance score between **0 and 1**
- Higher weight means the rubric is more critical to answering the question correctly
- Weights do not need to sum to 1

### Rubric quality (applies to every rubric)
- Make each rubric precise, atomic, and binary-checkable; avoid vague verbs.
- Anchor factual rubrics to concrete supporting statements from the material; do not invent new facts.
- Cover evidence breadth & attribution, reasoning soundness, completeness of expected findings, organization/clarity, and handling of ambiguity or counterpoints.
- Keep rubrics concise and avoid duplicate checks.
- Each rubric item must be evaluated independently and must not depend on the satisfaction or failure of any other rubric item.

### Question Construction
- The question should be motivated by the selected rubrics and evidence
- It should expose meaningful gaps, unresolved relationships, or implicit constraints
- It must NOT be fully answerable using the provided material alone
- Do NOT explicitly list rubrics or solution steps in the question
- Prefer questions that are brief, precise, and research-heavy, rather than descriptive or essay-like. Avoid trivial, purely descriptive, or artificially verbose questions
- Do NOT invent facts beyond the material
- You MUST generate a minimum of 5 rubrics in the output
- The rubrics should be numbered sequentially (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5...)

# Material

    # action
    action = '''You are an autonomous action controller in a deep-research question construction pipeline.

Your task is to iteratively improve the difficulty and research quality of a question whose correct answer must take the form of a **long-form, structured report** by selecting EXACTLY ONE action at each step.

GLOBAL CONSTRAINT (MUST HOLD AT ALL TIMES):
- The question must preserve ONE single research target.
- You MUST generate a minimum of 5 rubrics in the output
- Difficulty must arise from deeper or broader investigation of the SAME target,
  NOT from concatenating multiple unrelated questions or introducing parallel goals.

RUBRIC EXPECTATIONS (ALWAYS APPLY):
- Keep rubrics as precise, atomic, binary-checkable rubric items; avoid vague verbs.
- Tie factual rubrics to existing supporting statements; do not invent facts.
- Cover evidence & attribution, reasoning soundness, coverage/scope, clarity/structure, and handling of ambiguity or counterpoints.
- Keep rubric checks concise, non-duplicative, and grounded.
- Each rubric item must be evaluated independently and must not depend on the satisfaction or failure of any other rubric item.

Difficulty should increase progressively through:
- discovering missing or implicit research obligations,
- grounding existing obligations with sufficient evidence,
- or improving how the question is framed as a research problem.

You MUST choose the most appropriate next action based on the current state.
If an action would violate the single research target constraint, it is INVALID.

---

## Available Actions (choose ONE)


- **EXPAND**  
  Choose this action when:
  - the current rubrics appear incomplete, shallow, or under-specified,
  - the question could benefit from broader context, alternative perspectives,
    deeper mechanisms, or unresolved aspects,
  - and additional exploration is needed to discover *new or missing*
    research obligations.

- **RETRIEVE**  
  Choose this action when:
  - the research obligations are already identified,
  - but existing evidence is insufficient, thin, or homogeneous,
  - and more factual grounding is needed to support the SAME rubrics.

- **REWRITE**  
  Choose this action when:
  - the question wording is too explicit, checklist-like, or trivially solvable,
  - the question does not read like a genuine research or investigation prompt,
  - or recent rubric updates should be implicitly reflected in the wording.

- **EXIT**  
   - the question has ONE clear and coherent research target,
   - all research obligations are sufficiently identified and explicitly defined through a comprehensive set of rubrics,
   - each rubric must be specific, atomic, and actionable, providing clear evaluation dimensions and evidentiary requirements for assessing the answer,
   - answering the question requires multi-step reasoning, critical thinking, and the synthesis and verification of evidence from diverse sources,
   - and further actions would risk introducing artificial difficulty, goal drift, or disrupting the research integrity and evaluative balance of the current question.

'''
    


    REWRITE='''REWRITE: rewrite the question wording to improve research style or reduce trivial solvability, while preserving the SAME single research target.

You MAY rewrite the question to:
- improve abstraction, clarity, or research-style framing,
- reduce explicit clues, shortcuts, or checklist-like phrasing,
- make the question sound like a genuine research or investigation prompt.

You are NOT required to explicitly reflect every rubric in the question.
However, when appropriate, you SHOULD allow changes in the rubrics
(e.g., newly added or refined research obligations)
to be implicitly suggested through the scope, framing, or level of abstraction
of the rewritten question.

Constraints:
- You MUST preserve the underlying research target.
- You MUST NOT enumerate rubrics or solution steps.
- You MUST NOT introduce new research goals or parallel inquiries.

The rewritten question should remain minimal and natural,
while implicitly accommodating the current set of research rubrics.

Return JSON:
```json
{
  "action": "REWRITE",
  "question": "rewritten question with the same research target and implicit alignment to current rubrics",
  "note": "what was rewritten and whether any rubric changes were implicitly reflected"
}
```'''
    RETRIEVE='''RETRIEVE: propose search queries to gather additional supporting statements for EXISTING research rubrics.

Purpose:
- ground factual rubrics,
- expand evidence coverage or heterogeneity,
- support deeper reasoning for the SAME research target.

Constraints:
- You MUST NOT retrieve evidence for a new or unrelated question.
- Each query must map to an existing rubric.

Return JSON:

    EXIT='''EXIT: stop editing the question when it is already a good deep-research question.
1. the question requires extensive research to find the correct answer
2. Direct answer accuracy has dropped to a low, stable level
3. The question does NOT leak the exact answer span, document title, or a unique easily searchable string.

You should:
- propose search queries that explore broader context, alternative perspectives,
  deeper mechanisms, or unresolved aspects related to the SAME research target,
- use retrieval to surface signals for potential rubric expansion.

Constraints:
